# üß† Employee Salary Prediction

This project was developed as part of my **Virtual Internship Program** by Edunet Foundation in collaboration with AICTE and industry partners. The objective is to build a machine learning model that predicts employee salary  based on job attributes like title, experience, company size, location, and more.

## üìå Project Objective

To predict the salary category of an employee (e.g., Low, Mid, High) using machine learning algorithms based on job-related features.

## üóÉÔ∏è Dataset Information

- Rows: ~15,000
- Columns: 19
- Key Columns Used:
  - `job_title`
  - `experience_level`
  - `employment_type`
  - `company_location` 
  - `company_size`
  - `remote_ratio`
  -  `industry`
  - ` education_required`

Preprocessing included:
- Dropping irrelevant columns (`job_id`, `salary_currency`, etc.)
- Label encoding categorical variables
- Mapping locations to regions (Asia, Europe, etc.)
- Grouping job titles into major roles (Engineer, Analyst, etc.)
- Converting continuous salary to categorical labels (Low, Mid, High or 8 classes)

## üìà Model Performance

- **Algorithm Used**: Gradient Boosting Classifier
- **Accuracy**: ~84% (on test data with 4 salary categories)
- **Feature Importance** analyzed and tuned
- Dataset split into Train/Test (75/25)

## üíª Web Interface

The project is integrated with a **Flask web app** where users can input job details and get salary category predictions in real-time.


## üöÄ How to Run

1. Clone the repository  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/czzz34/Employee-Salary-Prediction.git
   cd Employee-Salary-Prediction
